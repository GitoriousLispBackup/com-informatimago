Informatimago Public Common Lisp Libraries
==========================================


common-lisp/

    The sublibrary systems provided by this library should contain
    only pure conformant Common Lisp packages.

    They should compile and run in all Common Lisp compliant
    implementations, and should have make use of no external package
    (eg. compatibility library) and no other (implementation
    dependant) package than COMMON-LISP.  They should not use #+/#- to
    activate or disable implementation specific code. [There remains
    some packages using #+/#- with implementations specific variants,
    we're working on removing these forms].


clext/

    Common Lisp Extensions.

    This directory contains Common-Lisp packages that are
    mostly portable, but that use some extensions,
    packages out of the Common-Lisp specifications, like
    GRAY or other portability libraries.


clmisc/

    Miscellaneous Common Lisp packages.


clisp/

    clisp specific packages.


susv3/

    POSIX API (clisp specific for now).


tools/

    Various tools to help developing and compiling these packages.
    (Mostly obsolete since the introduction of ASDF and Quicklisp).


rdp/

    Simple Recursive-Descent Parser.


objcl/

    Objective-CL reader macros.


small-cl-pgms/

    Various small lisp programs and proof-of-concept demos.
    Those are not gathered with ASDF system definitions.

    To push to gitorious:
        git push gitorious master


TODO
==================

- create a library for low level utilities (eg. proper-list-p) that
  are used by several libraries to break circular dependencies.

- do we need a bug tracker?  so far the number of bug reports per year
  doesn't really justify it.
