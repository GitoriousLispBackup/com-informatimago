Informatimago Public Common Lisp Libraries
==========================================


common-lisp/

    The sublibrary systems provided by this library should contain
    only pure conformant Common Lisp packages.

    They should compile and run in all Common Lisp compliant
    implementations, and should have make use of no external package
    (eg. compatibility library) and no other (implementation
    dependant) package than COMMON-LISP.  They should not use #+/#- to
    activate or disable implementation specific code. [There remains
    some packages using #+/#- with implementations specific variants,
    we're working on removing these forms].


clext/

    Common Lisp Extensions.

    This directory contains Common-Lisp packages that are
    mostly portable, but that use some extensions,
    packages out of the Common-Lisp specifications, like
    GRAY or other portability libraries.


clmisc/

    Miscellaneous Common Lisp packages.


clisp/

    clisp specific packages.


sbcl/

    sbcl specific packages.


susv3/

    POSIX API.


tools/

    Various tools to help developing and compiling these packages.
